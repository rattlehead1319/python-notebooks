michael madison could have allowed this one on his plate he almost seemed to know this wasn't going to work out and his performance was quite  so all you madison fans give this a miss\n","this film requires a lot of patience because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set in frances  the sandy dennis character apartment but the film builds to a disturbing climax br br the characters create an atmosphere  with sexual tension and psychological  it's very interesting that robert altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films still the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there i think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by sandy dennis it's definitely one of her darker characters but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary michael burns does a good job as the mute young man regular altman player michael murphy has a small part the  moody set fits the content of the story very well in short this movie is a powerful study of loneliness sexual  and desperation be patient  up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script br br i praise robert altman this is one of his many films that deals with unconventional fascinating subject matter this film is disturbing but it's sincere and it's sure to  a strong emotional response from the viewer if you want to see an unusual film some might even say bizarre this is worth the time br br unfortunately it's very difficult to find in video stores you may have to buy it off the internet\n","alive simultaneously while  for his part is depicted as a  white  guy in the clouds who looks like he'd rather be taking a  when  sends

citizens at random a title card  reads news of the king's  throughout the kingdom when the now terrified  once more   for help he loses his temper and  their community with lightning  the moral of our story delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten is let well enough alone br br considering the time period when this startling little film was made and considering the fact that it was made by a russian  at the height of that  country's civil war it would be easy to see this as a  about those events  may or may not have had  turmoil in mind when he made  but whatever  his choice of material the film stands as a  tale of universal   could be the soviet union italy germany or japan in the 1930s or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by  it's a fascinating film even a charming one in its macabre way but its message is no joke\n","i generally love this type of movie however this time i found myself wanting to kick the screen since i can't do that i will just complain about it this was absolutely idiotic the things that happen with the dead kids are very cool but the alive people are absolute idiots i am a grown man pretty big and i can defend myself well however i would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie also the mother in this movie is reckless with her children to the point of neglect i wish i wasn't so angry about her and her actions because i would have otherwise enjoyed the flick what a number she was take my advise and fast forward through everything you see her do until the end also is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark anymore one can hardly see what is being filmed as an audience we are  involved with the actions on the screen so then why the hell can't we have night vision\n","like some other people wrote i'm a die hard mario fan and i loved this game br br this game starts slightly boring but trust me it's worth it as soon as you start your hooked the levels are fun and  they will hook you  your mind turns to  i'm not kidding this game is also  and is beautifully done br br to keep this spoiler free i have to keep my mouth shut about details but please try this game it'll be worth it br br story 9 9 action 10 1 it's that good  10 attention  10 average 10\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gFrVV7w5zMut","colab_type":"text"},"source":["As we can see model is able to predict sentiment correctly."]}]}
